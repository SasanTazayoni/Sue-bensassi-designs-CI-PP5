## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

As my project uses Jinja syntax, such as `{% for loops %}`, `{% url 'home' %}`, and `{{ variable|filter }}` it will not validate properly if I copy and paste into the HTML validator straight from my source files. In order to properly validate these types of files, it's recommended to [validate by uri](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri) from the deployed Heroku pages.

Some of the pages on this site require a user to be logged-in and authenticated and will not work using this method, due to the fact that the HTML Validator (W3C) doesn't have access to login to the pages. In these cases the following steps have to be taken:

* Navigate to the deployed pages which require authentication.
* Right-click on the page and select View Page Source (usually `CTRL+U` or `âŒ˜+U` on Mac).
* This will display the entire "compiled" code, without any Jinja syntax.
* Copy everything, and use the [validate by input](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) method.
* Repeat this process for every page that requires a user to be logged-in/authenticated.

## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

### Python (Unit Testing)

I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality.

In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal each time:

`python3 manage.py test name-of-app `

To create the coverage report, I would then run the following commands:

`coverage run --source=name-of-app manage.py test`

`coverage report`

Here are the results my unit tests:

![screenshot](documentation/testing/pythonunittesting.png)

Below are the results from the various apps on my application that I've tested:

| App | Coverage | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cart | 95% | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/cart-coverage.png) |
| Checkout | 51% | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/checkout-coverage.png) |
| Contact | 97% | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/contact-coverage.png) |
| Core | 100% | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/core-coverage.png) |
| Newsletter | 93% | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/newsletter-coverage.png) |
| Products | 93% | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/products-coverage.png) |
| Profiles | 94% | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/profiles-coverage.png) |

#### Unit Test Issues

Unit testing the checkout page posed challenges due to the intricate interactions with Stripe elements. To mitigate these challenges, the focus was primarily on testing form validation, given the complexities and uncertainties surrounding other aspects of the page.
