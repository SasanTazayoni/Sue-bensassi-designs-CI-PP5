## UX

At Sue Bensassi Designs, the website is meticulously crafted to deliver an engaging and intuitive user experience (UX), anchored by a deliberate design approach emphasising both aesthetics and functionality.

The design philosophy revolves around simplicity and elegance, employing a neutral colour palette chosen to convey professionalism and timeless appeal. This choice ensures that the focus remains on the bespoke home accessories showcased throughout the site. Clean lines and uncluttered layouts enhance visual clarity, making navigation and exploration seamless. The final design strikes a balance between contemporary flair and unique elements, all while maintaining a simple and user-friendly interface.

Upon arriving at the website, visitors encounter a clean and inviting interface that sets the tone for a pleasant browsing experience. The design ensures that every element, from the placement of navigation menus to the arrangement of product images and descriptions, enhances usability and encourages exploration.

Navigation is intuitive and user-friendly, facilitated by a persistent menu that grants immediate access to various product categories, informational pages, and shopping essentials. This approach ensures that customers can find what they need quickly and efficiently, whether browsing the curated collection of ready-made items or exploring bespoke customisation options.

Transparency is a cornerstone of the design ethos. The shopping cart and its running total are prominently displayed throughout the browsing journey, empowering customers to manage their selections with confidence. This transparency extends to detailed product pages, where comprehensive information and high-quality images enable customers to make informed decisions.

Customisation lies at the heart of the service, offering a diverse range of fabrics, designs, and customisation options to cater to individual tastes and preferences. Whether choosing from pre-made items or opting for bespoke creations using their own fabric, the design approach ensures that each piece reflects the customer's unique style and vision.

The footer serves as a convenient hub for quick links to essential information, ensuring easy access to detailed product information, delivery policies, and contact options.

In essence, Sue Bensassi Designs combines craftsmanship with user-centric design principles to redefine the online shopping experience for home accessories. The website serves as a platform for showcasing products and as a gateway to an immersive journey where customers can explore, customise, and find inspiration.


### Colour Scheme

The aim was to create a clean, professional, and modern aesthetic for the site, using a combination of bold and subtle colours to ensure clarity and enhance the user experience.

- #000000 (black) is used for text, headings, and buttons, providing a strong contrast and ensuring readability and emphasis.
- #6C757D (gray) is used for the footer and navigation links, giving these areas a more subdued and refined appearance.
- #E6E6E6 (light gray) is used for borders and card bodies, adding a subtle separation between elements without being too stark.
- #FAF7F7 (very light gray) is used for various backgrounds, offering a soft and neutral backdrop that complements the other colours.
- #FFFFFF (white) is used for the navbar, footer text, button text, card header elements, and form backgrounds, maintaining a clean and crisp look throughout the site.

This colour scheme ensures a balance between modern design and usability, making the site visually appealing and easy to navigate.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/000000-6c757d-e6e6e6-faf7f7-ffffff) to generate my colour palette.

![screenshot](documentation/coolors.png)

I've used CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.

```css
:root {
    --color-primary: rgb(108, 117, 125);
    --color-secondary: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
    --color-tertiary: rgb(230, 230, 230);
    --color-accent: rgba(182, 211, 229, 0.5);
    --color-text: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1);
    --x: 45deg;
}
```

### Typography

- [Pavanam](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pavanam) for headings:

	- Bold and Distinctive: Pavanam's bold and clean lines make it ideal for headings, ensuring that key information stands out and grabs attention.
	- Modern Look: The contemporary style of Pavanam complements the modern aesthetic of the site, reinforcing the professional and polished appearance.

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) for the body:

	- Readability: Montserrat is known for its excellent readability, making it perfect for body text where clarity is crucial.
	- Versatile and Elegant: Montserrat's versatile design adapts well to various screen sizes and resolutions, maintaining a sleek and elegant look across different devices.
	- Consistency: Using Montserrat for body text ensures a consistent reading experience, allowing users to easily navigate and consume content without distraction.

Together, these fonts create a harmonious balance between striking headings and readable body text, enhancing the overall visual appeal and functionality of the website.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Database Design

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) help to visualise database architecture before creating models. Understanding the relationships between different tables can save time later in the project. Initially an ERD was established using [draw.io](https://draw.io/) as follows:

![screenshot](documentation/erd.png)

This ERD was later updated using `pygraphviz` and `django-extensions` to auto-generate an ERD.

The steps taken were as follows:
- In the terminal: `sudo apt update`
- then: `sudo apt-get install python3-dev graphviz libgraphviz-dev pkg-config`
- then type `Y` to proceed
- then: `pip3 install django-extensions pygraphviz`
- in my `settings.py` file, I added the following to my `INSTALLED_APPS`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'django_extensions',
    ...
]
```
- back in the terminal: `python3 manage.py graph_models -a -o erd.png`
- dragged the new `erd.png` file into my `documentation/` folder
- removed `'django_extensions',` from my `INSTALLED_APPS`
- finally, in the terminal: `pip3 uninstall django-extensions pygraphviz -y`

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/SasanTazayoni/Sue-bensassi-designs-CI-PP5/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project.
It isn't a specialised tool, but with the right tags and project creation/issue assignments, it can be made to work.

Through it, user stories, issues, and milestone tasks were planned, then tracked on a weekly basis using the basic Kanban board.

![screenshot](documentation/kanban.png)

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/SasanTazayoni/Sue-bensassi-designs-CI-PP5/issues) served as an another Agile tool.
There, I used my own **User Story Template** to manage user stories.

- [Open Issues](https://github.com/SasanTazayoni/Sue-bensassi-designs-CI-PP5/issues)

![screenshot](documentation/issues-open.png)

- [Closed Issues](https://github.com/SasanTazayoni/Sue-bensassi-designs-CI-PP5/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

![screenshot](documentation/issues-closed.png)
![screenshot](documentation/issues-closed2.png)

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into stories prior to prioritizing and implementing them.
Using this approach, I was able to apply the MoSCow prioritisation and labels to my user stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered (*max 60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration

## Ecommerce Business Model

This site sells goods to individual customers, and therefore follows a `Business to Customer` model.
It is of the simplest **B2C** forms, as it focuses on individual transactions, and doesn't need anything
such as monthly/annual subscriptions.

It is still in its early development stages, although it already has a newsletter, and links for social media marketing.

Social media can potentially build a community of users around the business, and boost site visitor numbers,
especially when using larger platforms such a Facebook.

A newsletter list can be used by the business to send regular messages to site users.
For example, what items are on special offer, new items in stock,
updates to business hours, notifications of events, and much more!

## Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) & Social Media Marketing

### Keywords

I've identified some appropriate keywords to align with my site, that should help users
when searching online to find my page easily from a search engine.
This included a series of the following keyword types

- Short-tail (head terms) keywords
- Long-tail keywords

I also played around with [Word Tracker](https://www.wordtracker.com) a bit
to check the frequency of some of my site's primary keywords (only until the free trial expired).

### Sitemap

I've used [XML-Sitemaps](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com) to generate a sitemap.xml file.
This was generated using my deployed site URL: https://sue-bensassi-designs-beea48c7d401.herokuapp.com/

After it finished crawling the entire site, it created a
[sitemap.xml](sitemap.xml) which I've downloaded and included in the repository.

### Robots

I've created the [robots.txt](robots.txt) file at the root-level.
Inside, I've included the default settings:

```
User-agent: *
Disallow:
Sitemap: https://sue-bensassi-designs-beea48c7d401.herokuapp.com/sitemap.xml
```

Further links for future implementation:
- [Google search console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
- [Creating and submitting a sitemap](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/sitemaps/build-sitemap)
- [Managing your sitemaps and using sitemaps reports](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451001)
- [Testing the robots.txt file](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062598)

### Social Media Marketing

Creating a strong social base (with participation) and linking that to the business site can help drive sales.
Using more popular providers with a wider user base, such as Facebook, typically maximises site views.

![screenshot](documentation/mockup-facebook.png)
![screenshot](documentation/mockup-facebook2.png)

### Newsletter Marketing

I have incorporated a newsletter sign-up form on my application, to allow users to supply their
email address if they are interested in learning more.

A custom newsletter app was developed for this project, incorporating a NewsletterSubscription model. I also included a form in the site's footer to gather user email addresses.

```python
class NewsletterSubscription(models.Model):
    email = models.EmailField(
        unique=True, null=False, blank=False
    )

    def __str__(self):
        return self.email
```

Only valid and non-duplicated emails can sign up. The user will receive an email if they successfully subscribe. There are screenshots of these in the "Features" section above.

## Testing

> [!NOTE]  
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://sue-bensassi-designs-beea48c7d401.herokuapp.com).

### PostgreSQL Database

This project uses a [Code Institute PostgreSQL Database](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net).

To obtain my own Postgres Database from Code Institute, I followed these steps:

- Signed-in to the CI LMS using my email address.
- An email was sent to me with my new Postgres Database.

> [!CAUTION]  
> - PostgreSQL databases by Code Institute are only available to CI Students.
> - You must acquire your own PostgreSQL database through some other method
> if you plan to clone/fork this repository.
> - Code Institute students are allowed a maximum of 8 databases.
> - Databases are subject to deletion after 18 months.

### Cloudinary API

This project uses the [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com) to store media assets online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

To obtain your own Cloudinary API key, create an account and log in.

- For *Primary interest*, you can choose *Programmable Media for image and video API*.
- Optional: *edit your assigned cloud name to something more memorable*.
- On your Cloudinary Dashboard, you can copy your **API Environment Variable**.
- Be sure to remove the `CLOUDINARY_URL=` as part of the API **value**; this is the **key**.

### Stripe API

This project uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to handle the ecommerce payments.

Once you've created a Stripe account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click to expand the "Get your test API keys".
- You'll have two keys here:
	- `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` = Publishable Key (starts with **pk**)
	- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` = Secret Key (starts with **sk**)

As a backup, in case users prematurely close the purchase-order page during payment, we can include Stripe Webhooks.

- From your Stripe dashboard, click **Developers**, and select **Webhooks**.
- From there, click **Add Endpoint**.
	- `https://sue-bensassi-designs-beea48c7d401.herokuapp.com/checkout/wh/`
- Click **receive all events**.
- Click **Add Endpoint** to complete the process.
- You'll have a new key here:
	- `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` = Signing Secret (Wehbook) Key (starts with **wh**)

### Gmail API

This project uses [Gmail](https://mail.google.com) to handle sending emails to users for account verification and purchase order confirmations.

Once you've created a Gmail (Google) account and logged-in, follow these series of steps to get your project connected.

- Click on the **Account Settings** (cog icon) in the top-right corner of Gmail.
- Click on the **Accounts and Import** tab.
- Within the section called "Change account settings", click on the link for **Other Google Account settings**.
- From this new page, select **Security** on the left.
- Select **2-Step Verification** to turn it on. (verify your password and account)
- Once verified, select **Turn On** for 2FA.
- Navigate back to the **Security** page, and you'll see a new option called **App passwords**.
- This might prompt you once again to confirm your password and account.
- Select **Mail** for the app type.
- Select **Other (Custom name)** for the device type.
	- Any custom name, such as "Django" or Sue-bensassi-designs-CI-PP5
- You'll be provided with a 16-character password (API key).
	- Save this somewhere locally, as you cannot access this key again later!
	- `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` = user's 16-character API key
	- `EMAIL_HOST_USER` = user's own personal Gmail email address

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL` | user's own value |
| `HOST` | user's own value |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `EMAIL_HOST_PASS` | user's own value |
| `EMAIL_HOST_USER` | user's own value |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |
| `STRIPE_WH_SECRET` | user's own value |
| `TEMP_EMAIL` | user's own value |

Heroku needs three additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile
- runtime.txt

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

The **runtime.txt** file needs to know which Python version you're using:
1. type: `python3 --version` in the terminal.
2. in the **runtime.txt** file, add your Python version:
	- `python-3.9.18`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_PASS", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("EMAIL_HOST_USER", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("TEMP_EMAIL", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `⌘+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

If you'd like to backup your database models, use the following command for each model you'd like to create a fixture for:

- `python3 manage.py dumpdata your-model > your-model.json`
- *repeat this action for each model you wish to backup*

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SasanTazayoni/Sue-bensassi-designs-CI-PP5) 
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it 
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
	- `git clone https://github.com/SasanTazayoni/Sue-bensassi-designs-CI-PP5.git`
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

Alternatively, if using Gitpod, you can click below to create your own workspace using this repository.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/SasanTazayoni/Sue-bensassi-designs-CI-PP5)

Please note that in order to directly open the project in Gitpod, you need to have the browser extension installed.
A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SasanTazayoni/Sue-bensassi-designs-CI-PP5)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!

### Local VS Deployment

In the local environment:
* All variables are retrieved from the env.py file.
* DEBUG is set to "True".
* DEVELOPMENT is set to "True" therefore emails are generated in the terminal.

On Heroku:
* All variables are retrieved from the Config Vars in the settings.
* DEBUG is set to "False".
* The DEVELOPMENT variable is absent therefore defaults to "False" which allows emails to be sent directly using the Gmail API.
